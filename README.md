# Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a well known computation which models, well, life!

The goal of this package is to write a server-client based implementation with the server being implemented for multiple languages.
The client will be written in JS and possibly later moved to [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

Where possible, good coding practices will be followed, such as unit tests and performance checks.
